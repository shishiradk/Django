## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can predict the quality of wine based on its chemical attributes. All tasks are performed in a single, interactive Jupyter Notebook: `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`.

**Main Steps:**
- 🔧 Data preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🧱 Feature engineering  
- 🧠 Model training & evaluation  
- 📈 Visualization of results

> 🎯 **Goal**: Help users understand the complete ML workflow using a real-world dataset.

## 🔍 Features

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize feature distributions & correlations
- Detect patterns influencing wine quality

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values  
- Feature scaling & normalization  
- Encode categorical data

### 🧠 Modeling
- Train classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning

### 📈 Evaluation
- Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- Compare models and select the best

### 📉 Visualization
- Feature importance plots  
- Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and decision boundaries
