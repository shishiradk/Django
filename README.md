# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. The analysis and model development are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook: `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`. The notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualization

The goal is to demonstrate the application of machine learning to a real-world dataset, helping users understand the steps involved in building predictive models.

## 🔍 Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Comprehensive visualization of data distributions, correlations, and patterns  
- Identification of key features influencing wine quality

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values (if any)  
- Scaling and normalization of features  
- Encoding categorical variables

### Modeling

- Training multiple machine learning models for classification  
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance

### Evaluation

- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Comparison of model performance to select the best-performing model

### Visualization

- Visualization of feature importance and decision boundaries  
- Performance plots such as confusion matrices and ROC curves
