Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. The analysis and model development are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, wine_quality_prediction.ipynb, which includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning methodologies to a real-world dataset, enabling users to understand the steps involved in building predictive models.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Comprehensive visualization of data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Identification of key features influencing wine quality.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, if any.
Scaling and normalization of features.
Encoding categorical variables.
Modeling:

Training multiple machine learning models for classification.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
Evaluation:

Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Comparison of model performance to identify the best-performing model.
Visualization:

Visualization of feature importance and decision boundaries.
Generation of performance plots such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
